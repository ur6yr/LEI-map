# ML techniques on LEI data represented in a graph database

See LEI_Project_Summary.pdf for detailed description of this endeavor.

The original idea for this project came from globalids but was developed further at Pennapps fall 2019. Shell scripts to load the data into TigerGraph and extracting that data to a python notebook is provided. The actual python code will be committed soon as it is not available to me locally to commit now.

Using TigerGraph to create a comprehensive map of the American financial landscape. Using Sci-Kit Learn, Tensorflow, and Keras to analyze this massive graph (such as clustering) and drawing conclusions.
